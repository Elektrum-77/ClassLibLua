HOW TO USE :
-- first require the library where you want to create a class
local Object = require "ObjectLib"


-- there more than one way to create your calss but they are all the same

local MyClass = newClass({}, Object)

local MyClass = newClass()

local MyClass = {}
newClass(MyClass)


-- now to add a field to the class you will have to add it to MyClass.fields
-- the downside in this librairy is that you can't have a field without a default value but who wouldn't need it anyway ?
MyClass.fields = {
  name = "Roberto",
}

-- to use this field you don't have to do anything out of the ordinary
function MyClass:sayName()
  print(self.name)
end

-- to create an object of your class you can do something like this
MyObject = MyClass:new({name = "Angela"})

-- then use it's method like this :
MyObject:sayName()
-- this will print Angela
